		System.out.println('b'+'c');
		//Prints: 197
		//Because: Java used the ASCII code of 'b' which equals 98 and 'c' which equals 99 to produce a value (or character) to print.
		//Java then used its programing power to add up these two numbers to ‘197’ exactly.

		//Prints: e
		//Because: Java knows the ASCII code for 'a' is 97 and added that value with the number 4.
		//The total would equal 101 and since with specified the char of 101 is equivalent to the ASCII ‘e’, that's whats printed.
