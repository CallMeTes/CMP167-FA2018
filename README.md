# CMP167-FA2018
This is the repository of assignments from my CMP167 class for FA2018 @LehmanCollege

An Introduction:

"Dude in the Fedora" here making my introduction to you!

My name is Tesfa ************, pleased to meet you.

I'm a Computer Information Systems (SP'19) major taking this CMP 167 course to use as credits towards my CIS degree. I have the ability to replace CIS 166 with this class and as well, I'm entertaining to possibility of doing more CMP courses before graduating.

I enjoy our campus and enjoy conversing with students and encouraging students.

I will be working on-campus this Fall 2018 for the Center of Leadership Development. If interested in learning more about leadership, networking, advocacy or finding jobs on and off campus, please do contact me.

Also, the Student Life Building is where our offices are located, ask around, stop on in, and, introduce yourself. The Student Life Building (SLB) is where you will find clubs, organizations and student government on campus.

Finally, I am apart of the 'Lehman College Underground Student Radio', talk to me before or after class if you are interested in joining.

Peace! Have a good weekend class!
